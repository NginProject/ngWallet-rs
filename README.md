NOTE:

An offline wallet, also known as cold storage, provides the highest level of security for savings.
It involves storing a wallet in a secured place that is not connected to the network (air-gapped).
When done properly, it can offer a very good protection against computer vulnerabilities.
```

Distributed as a Rust crate or can be embedded via foreign function interface (FFI).

For minimalistic CLI tool refer to [ngWallet CLI](https://github.com/NginProject/ngWallet-cli), or if you looking for a fully-featured UI online wallet, take a look at [ngWallet GUI](https://github.com/NginProject/ngWallet)
